# Usage
After right clicking the chest/double chest with a tripwire hook, write the password in the sign gui to assign it.
Then when assigned, you can try to open the chest, and you will be met with a sign gui to insert the password.

# World Guard
This plugin is compatible with world guard, if the user doesn't have the flag `BLOCK_PLACE` then they cannot assign a password.
